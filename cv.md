### About me
I'm 23 y.o.
In 2021 I've been relocated from Belarus.
Currently i live in Poland, Krakow, but I don't want to sit at one place forever and have plans to move further west or to another continent even.


### Education
##### Bachelor's degree: BSEU - Faculty of Digital Economy [Informatics in the economic sphere] - 2016-2020.

### Work Experience:
#### EPAM Systems: May 2019 - Now
My path in IT sphere has started in 2019 when I joined EPAM as a Junior Performance Analyst. 
I was at 3rd year of studying in university and I was able to perfectly combine study and work. 
I've been promoted to Middle position rather quickly and now I'm preparing for Seniority level. 
I've gained a lot of experience since i've came to the company, got acquainted with lots of tools, computing languages, frameworks. 
Apart from developing on my current position I want to try a brand new direction for me as Web Development has always attracted me. 
Along with theoretical knowledge I'm eager to gain practical experience here. 
I do not exclude in the future the change of the current role to the role of a Front-End Developer.
